# SLES_530.24 - Altered Beast

{% include table_header %}
| DVD5 | HDL ZSO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1910 | HDD | 1 | YES | YES | YES | YES | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | With GSM activated the game will be slow as if the fps is low, even if you increase the zso cache or activate mode 2 it will not change the slowdowns and crashes with GSM, but it works, however, I do not recommend it !
