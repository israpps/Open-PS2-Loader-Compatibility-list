| DVD5 | ISO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1938 | USB |  | YES | YES | YES | YES | working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | Apparently there is FMV crash, GSM works more differently from some other games, like altered beast, where enabling it, makes the game extremely slow. This one does the opposite, makes the game extremely fast as if it had very high FPS, I don't recommend using it, but it works.
| DVD5 | ZSO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1938 | USB |  | YES | YES | YES | NO | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | Apparently there is FMV glitch, different from the iso version of this game the GSM will not start it will be in a black screen where IGR does not work you will have to restart the console. PS: ISO is 2.4 GB ZSO is 1.75 GB, note from what I observed that some contributors of this game in the zso version may have some incompatibility with some models of consoles and usb devices I could not report these same errors or problems, but I was observed and reported by them.
