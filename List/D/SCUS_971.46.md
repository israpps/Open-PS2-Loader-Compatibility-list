| DVD5 | ISO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1938 | USB |  | YES | YES | YES | YES | working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | Apparently there is FMV crash, GSM works more differently from some other games, like altered beast, where enabling it, makes the game extremely slow. This one does the opposite, makes the game extremely fast as if it had very high FPS, I don't recommend using it, but it works.
