| DVD5 | ISO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1955 | USB | 6 | YES | NO | YES | NO | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | GSM does not work in cutscenes, it is impossible to play with it activated even after finishing, but in zso and iso the cutscenes work with a small delay and also FMV with more in zso than in iso via usb.
PADEMU: It seems to work well with DualShock 3, but with DualShock 4 the FMV tends to lock more, great chance of locking when picking up items or open the menu to load the save, making it impossible to play the game with a DualShock 4.
