| DVD5 | ZSO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1940 | USB | 2, 5 | NO | YES | NO | NO | imposible to play | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | Just for the game can start with compatibility modes, BDM Cache has to be in '18' to activate the GSM or VMC may end up leaving the game locked on the first introduction only being able to use IGR. The FMV of the game doesn't crash so much, but it can happen, and the game just collapses suddenly out of nowhere or loading screen, many times there can just be sudden collapse, that's right at any time of the game if it starts the gameplay or manage to get out of a loading screen!
