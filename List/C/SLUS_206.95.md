| DVD5 | ISO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1940 | USB | 5 | YES | YES | YES | YES | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001, SCPH-70001 | FAT VS. SLIM: The background music of this game during stages seems to freeze and repeat a 2-second sample continuously with a SLIM. And it doesn't seem to happen with a PHAT unit. So if you have a Slim, it is best to become the background music down to 0. Many crashes in FMV are less than zso, however map loading seems faster in zso, to use GSM you need to disable FIELD Flipping Emulation.
