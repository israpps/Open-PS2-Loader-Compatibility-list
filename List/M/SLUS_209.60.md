| DVD5 | ZSO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1940 | USB |  | YES | YES | YES | YES | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | IGR now seems to be working with VMC that previously didn't work with this game, it was required to activate mode 6 the FMVs have small crashes, but you can watch. PS: ISO has 2.28 GB ZSO has 970.86 MB, it is more worthwhile to use zso, because even with faster loading in iso, FMVs will crash equally in either version.
