# SLUS_213.55 - Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition Remix

{% include table_header %}
| DVD9 | ISO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1901 | USB |  | NO | YES | YES | YES | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | In zso the intro and FMV scenes stutter, some construction cracks during the game, otherwise it works perfectly and in iso the intros don't stutter, however the FMV scenes stutter and even more in the .ul test on the exfat device. In previous versions of opl vmc ends up corrupting, vmc can still occur on smb and usb as before, but in my tests on usb so far nothing happens, anything is better not to use.
